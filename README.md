**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

- Liam is the owner of DriverPass, an educational service to help people pass their driving test and obtain a license.
The goal of the project was to develop a system that allows DriverPass customers to receive online and on-the-road driving training.
The system must facilitate online classes, practice tests, in-person driving lesson reservations and allow DriverPass employees to manage user accounts and log data.

**What did you do particularly well?**

- I believe what I did particularly well was ensuring the system's functionality matched the specific requirements discussed in the DriverPass interview.
The system is designed to be highly responsive and works across various devices and browsers, crucial for the easy and flexible online training DriverPass aims to provide.
Additionally, every role is clearly outlined for a clear user experience.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

- I would refine the limitations section of the Business Requirements Document.
Recognizing the system's heavy reliance on cloud services like AWS,
I would add limitations regarding potential service disruptions that could impact system availability.
My UML sequence diagram for customer appointment scheduling could also use some work to appear less disjounted.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

- Carefully considering the requirements of the owner and IT officer for DriverPass interview helped me define the DriverPass system effectively and accurately. 
For example, the IT officer, Ian made it clear the system should be on a cloud service and the Owner, Liam wanted their to be online bookings and discussed the type of users there would be on the service.
These helped me decide on important factors like the functionality of each account's roles and what the service would run on.
The design process should be aligned with the clients needs in order to avoid costly redesigns and mis-managed time.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

- This course has helped me improve my ability to interept user needs in order to define clear, actionable requirements which will be useful in future designs. Additionally, the ability to create UML diagrams to outline a systems architecture and interactions and will be useful for effectively explaining a project's design components.
